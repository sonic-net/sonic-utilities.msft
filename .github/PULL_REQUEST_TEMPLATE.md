** Make sure all your commits include a signature generated with `git commit -s` **

If this is a bug fix, make sure your description includes "closes #xxxx",
"fixes #xxxx" or "resolves #xxxx" so that GitHub automatically closes the related

If you are modifying or removing an existing 'show', 'config' or 'sonic-clear'
subcommand, or you are adding a new subcommand, please make sure you also
update the Command Line Reference Guide (doc/Command-Reference.md) to reflect
your changes.

Please provide the following information:
-->

**- What I did**

**- How I did it**

**- How to verify it**

**- Previous command output (if the output of a command-line utility has changed)**

**- New command output (if the output of a command-line utility has changed)**
